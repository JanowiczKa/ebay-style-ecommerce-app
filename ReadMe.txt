Make sure you have all the dependencies installed (the versions are ones I used but should work with higher versions as well)
 - react-scripts
 - NodeJs
 - React
├── bcrypt@5.0.1
├── express@4.18.2
├── mongoose@6.2.6
├── multer@1.4.4
├── nodemon@2.0.15
└── react-router-dom@6.2.1


(I used VS code) Open the project at the root, "cd backend" -> "npm start".
open a new terminal "cd frontend" -> "npm start".
the website should open on your default browser.
